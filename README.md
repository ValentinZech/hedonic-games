# hedonic-games

This project is meant as an addition to the software tools related to Computational Social Choice ([COMSOC community page](https://comsoc-community.org/tools)), and is in a very early stage of development. 

For an introduction to *hedonic games* see, e.g., the [survey by Aziz and Savani](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/handbook-of-computational-social-choice/hedonic-games/F85B34A40AD7BBFE58B2698A3319ED41) [1]

At this current stage, the project focuses solely on *additively separable hedonic games*.
